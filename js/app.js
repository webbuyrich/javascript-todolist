//Problem: User interation doesn't provide desired results.
//Solution: Add interactivity so the user can manage daily tasks.

//Add New task
	//When the button is pressed
	//Create a new list item with the text from #new-task:
		//input(checkbox)
		//label
		//input(text)
		//button.edit
		//button.delete
		//Each element will need to be modified and appended







//Edit an existing task
	//When the Edit button is pressed
	//If the parent has the class .editMode
		//Switch from .editMode
		//label text become the input's value
	//else
		//Switch to .editMode
		//input value becomes the label's text

	//Togle .editMode on the parent






//Delete an existing task
	//When the Delete button is pressed
		//Remove the parent list item from the ul
	






//Mark a task as complete
	//When the checkbox is checked
		//Append the task list item to the #completed-tasks







//Mark a task as incomplete
	//When checkbox is unchecked
		//Append to incomplete tasks
